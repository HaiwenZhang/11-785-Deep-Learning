This zip file contains some example test cases for 11-785's HW1 Part 1. 

In order to get started please place your submission python file in the hw1 folder and title it "hw1.py"

You can then run the tests by opening the python command line from the directory where this README file is located. This is done by typing "python" in a shell.

You can then do the following from the python command line:

>>> from test_problem_1 import *
>>> test_problem_1() 
>>>

If the function completes without error, as the above output implies, then the test passed and you should receive credit on autolab. 
If you encountered an assertion error, then your code failed the validity check because your weights/biases were not what was expected. You can specifically see if it was the weights or the biases by looking at the line of the assertion error.
If you encountered an exception, then the error is most likely in your code - while it is possible that there is an error with the test, it is unlikely.

All the tests can be run in this way, the only thing to note is that problem test_problem_6 has multiple tests that need to be run (with different names). You can examine test_problem_6.py for these different tests.

Please feel free to email or post on piazza with any questions or issues. 

Good Luck!






P.S. None of the data provided are from the tests on autolab, please don’t try pass the autolab tests using this data as your output, it won’t work
